# Description:-

Clickjacking, also known as UI redress attack, is a type of security vulnerability that tricks users into interacting with malicious elements on a web page without their knowledge. In a clickjacking attack, an attacker overlays or hides certain elements on a legitimate website, misleading users into clicking on unintended content. This can lead to unintended actions, such as unknowingly making purchases, granting permissions, or revealing sensitive information.


ClickJacking Scan is a specialized tool designed to detect and assess clickjacking vulnerabilities in web applications. It automates the process of scanning web pages and identifying potential clickjacking risks, allowing security professionals to proactively identify and mitigate this type of vulnerability. The ClickJacking Scan tool works by analyzing the response headers of web pages and inspecting the structure and content of the HTML to identify any indicators of clickjacking susceptibility. It checks for the presence of security-related headers, such as the "X-Frame-Options" header, which are commonly used to protect against clickjacking attacks.
