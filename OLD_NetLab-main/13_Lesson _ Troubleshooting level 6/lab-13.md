## Introduction to Native VLAN

802.1Q defines one of the special features known as Native Vlan ID. Basically, Native VLAN terminates the word of default VLAN which is VLAN 1. So Whenever A frame comes from the native VLAN then 802.1q doesn't add 802.1Q header(Vlan header) to the frame in the native VLAN.

## Misson
- In this lab, the Network administrator allows handling of the network to a junior network engineer, but he doesn't know anything about native VLAN, that's why he broke the whole network.


## Hint 
- identify the native vlans of switches

Thank You
