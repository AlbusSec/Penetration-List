## Introduction to Dynamic Etherchannel

Cisco switch gives two different configuration options that use a dynamic protocol to negotiate whether a particular link will be added on EtherChannel or not. Basically, The Configuration enables a protocol for a particular channel-group number, The concept is similar to DTP. 
Most Switches support two dynamic protocols, Cisco Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and IEEE Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).


## Misson

- In this lab, You are the Network Administrator, And Your network already run Pagp, But You have a task to implement LACP on your Network.


## Hint

- Use one of the commands to verify the Etherchannel Configuration.

Thank You
